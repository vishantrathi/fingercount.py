## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple finger counting algorithm using OpenCV and Python. The script captures video from your webcam and counts the number of fingers shown to the camera in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time finger counting**: Uses your webcam to detect and count fingers.
- **Efficient contour analysis**: Implements convex hull and convexity defects for accurate finger detection.
- **Easy to use**: Simple setup and straightforward execution.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/finger-counting-opencv.git
   cd finger-counting-opencv
