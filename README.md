# Finger Counting Using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV and Python to count the number of fingers held up in front of a webcam. It processes the video feed from the webcam, identifies contours, and determines the number of fingers displayed.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy
